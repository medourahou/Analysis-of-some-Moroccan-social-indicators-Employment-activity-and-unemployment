# Analysis-of-some-Moroccan-social-indicators-Employment-activity-and-unemployment

Data analysis is one of the trend fields today for its efficiency to analyse some phenomenon(compnay's revenues, social indicators,...).
This project aims to analyse some Moroccan social indicators:Employment,activity,and unemployment based on a dataset of the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (dataset details are in the file project_report.pdf). The process of analyse is done by applying Principal component analysis (PCA) which is an extremely powerful tool for synthesizing information, very useful when there is a large amount of quantitative data to process and interpret. 
This is done by using R studio and the PCA function of the FactoMineR package. Afterwards, we made our own implementation of PCA in python and made a small comparison between the two functions. You can read the two reports PCA_documentation.pdf and project_in_R.R
